= Exclusion/inclusion 

== Background 
A very important use-case for an eHealth system is to be able to express the exlusion of something. The `openEHR-EHR-EVALUATION.exclusion_specific.v1` archetype is modelled to cover this use-case. 

CAUTION: The content is still 'under-construction'

=== Archetypes

http://www.openehr.org/ckm/#showArchetype_1013.1.2737[openEHR-EHR-EVALUATION.exclusion_specific.v1]:: To record a statement of exclusion about a specific Problem/diagnosis, Family history, Medication, Procedure, Adverse reaction or other clinical item that is either not currently present, or have not been present in the past.
http://www.openehr.org/ckm/#showArchetype_1013.1.2733[openEHR-EHR-EVALUATION.exclusion_global.v1] :: An overall statement of exclusion about all Problems/diagnoses, Family history, Medications, Procedures, Adverse reactions or other clinical items that are either not currently present, or have not been present in the past.

== Surgery - as an use-case 
Surgery is a resource intensive activity in hospitals. The activity is planned, executed and documented. For this use-case we will focus on to preventive procedures: 

----
SNOMED-CT::421728001::Anticoagulant prophylaxis
SNOMED-CT::422181004::Antibiotic prophylaxis
----

=== In planning 
The surgeon will recommend what kind of prophylaxis procedure should be performed. This recommendation could be based on guidelines either locally or from other sources. 

Depending on the system/hospital the request and documentation of the prophylactic procedure might be on paper or in stated in an openEHR INSTRUCTION. 

=== Execution 
During surgery the team will either do as planned or abandon the plan related to the prophylactic procedures. 

This information might be recorded in a diversity of systems: 

* Paper based systems 
* Local surgery systems 
* As ACTIONS in the openEHR CDR 

=== Post surgery documentation 
When surgery is performed the surgery team needs to document what happended. The surgeon writes his summary of the procedure and as part of this there will some statements on what kind of prophylactic procedures was performed. 

Given that this statement is entered in an openEHR based system. Then the structures SHOULD be equal no matter if the execution documentation was in paper, local proprietary system or an advanced closed-loop openEHR system. 


=== Clinical modelling

In this simplified example we have a Template with four archetypes: 

. ACTION.procedure to document the performed surgery 
. ACTION.procedure to document if Antibiotic prophylaxis was performed
. ACTION.procedre to document if Thrombosis prophylaxis 
. EVALUATION.exclusion_specific to express if the prophylactic procedures where not performed.
